# Getting Started

## Overview

Welcome to the Fusotao official wiki! The purpose of this documentation is to help developers understand the basic conceptions of Fusotao and build their own reliable and trustless financial system by interacting with Fusotao. 

Fusotao is a permissionless blockchain based on [Substrate](https://substrate.dev). It contains a highly customed runtime difference from polkadot, though they both depends on some pallets such as `balances` and `grandpa`. The main purpose of Fusotao is to seperate the role of banks from the centralized exchanges which are shouln't combine into one, rather than building another general cross-chain system or a dex over polkadot. 

## Building a centralized exchange from scratch

If you would like to build a centralized exchange from scratch, the [Galois](https://github.com/uinb/galois) may be a good choice to getting start. It is a high performance implementaion of a matching engine as a core component of the exchange service. Refer to the [*Guide to implement a broker*](TODO).

## Interacting with Fusotao node

The UINB team maintains a set of SDKs hosted on [Github](https://github.com/uinb) to help developers interacting with Fusotao easier by auto generating code suited with the runtime metadata.
