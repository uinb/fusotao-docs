# User Guides

The Fusotao protocol provides one-stop decentralized financial services for crypto tokens.
The community can add liquidity for ERC20, BEP20, and NEP141 tokens without permission and enjoy a user experience that surpasses centralized order book exchanges. And all of this is based on a decentralized protocol, so there is no need to worry about asset security issues.
