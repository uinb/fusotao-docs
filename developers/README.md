# Developer Guides

Fusotao protocol is developed on Substrate. Unlike smart contract VM, changes to the protocol must be made through forkless network upgrades based on consensus. 
This chapter will mainly introduce how to integrate or develop based on the Fusotao protocol. If you want to contribute to the Fusotao functionality itself, please refer to the contribution guide in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/uinb/fusotao).
